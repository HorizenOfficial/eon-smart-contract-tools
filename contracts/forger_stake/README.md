# FORGER STAKE

## Overview

Code to interact with the new Eon sidechain forger stake delegation [smart contract]().

Address of the contract: **0x0000000000000000000022222222222222222333**

It provides two different ways to interact with the smart contract:
1. [remix](./docs/REMIX.md) - A set of scripts that can be imported into the Remix IDE to interact with the smart contract.
2. [js](./docs/JS.md) - A script that can be run using Node.js locally to interact with the smart contract.
